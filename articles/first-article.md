## Trump Expected to Win with an Average of 294 Electoral Votes

The Milbrandt Analytics 2024 election model forecasts a likely Trump win in November. With a surprising haul of 294 electoral votes, the former president is expected to turn several states Biden won in 2020.

## Methodology

Data for each state was aggregated using top polls conducted since March 2024. Given the uncertainty of even the best polls, confidence intervals are applied to the numbers, reasonable assumptions are made, and then everything is randomly run through hundreds of monte carlo simulations. This method is highly regarded as electoral college wins can happen in countless ways, and the complex combinations are underappreciated by simpler models.

## Key Findings

Trump is forecasted to have an 81.7% chance to win with an average of 294 electoral votes. The high probability of this victory seems to indicate a strong electoral edge but reflects a divided nation state-by-state. The result is unlikely to represent any kind of historical unity for the country, with just an 8.6% shot at exceeding Obama’s 2012 result of 332.

## Swing States

2020 featured several battleground states for one of the tightest results in recent history. Though the results still just lean toward Trump, each advantage leads to a cumulative probability favoring the former president.

### Arizona

2020 - 49.4% Biden, 49% Trump

2024 - 55% probability of Trump Victory

### Nevada

2020 - 50.1% Biden, 47.7% Trump

2024 - 69% probability of Trump Victory

### Georgia

2020 - 49.5% Biden, 49.2% Trump

2024 - 65% probability of Trump Victory

### Pennsylvania

2020 - 50% Biden, 48.8% Trump

2024 - 50.2% probability of Trump Victory

## Implications

Trump’s hold on the election is strengthening, but can Biden make a comeback? If Biden can hang on in the Rust Belt and get a win in Pennsylvania, then he can secure the 270 votes to win. The race is still tight at this point, and an effective campaign by either candidate could create enough swing to bring the election home. However, Trump has the lead for now, and the states he looks to be in control of now give him a significant edge to battle it out. A win in Michigan and Pennsylvania, for example, would put the election out of reach for Biden. Trump can be focused at this point, and Biden is on the defensive. Trump is forecast to have an 81.7% chance to win.
