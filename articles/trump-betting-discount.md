## Milbrandt Analytics Election Model is At Odds with Vegas

Real value may be on the table with the Trump betting odds. Those of us paying attention might be shocked to find that Real Clear Politics has Trump with just a 56.2% chance of winning the election. Our model indicates Trump has an 81.7% chance of winning, indicating a massive discount, with favorable polling in key states. It’s hard to argue with Vegas, but with an upside potential of nearly 78%, those odds are looking rather attractive. Let’s dive into why.

### The Competition is Decimated

Biden, currently Trump’s next closest challenger, has taken an absolute nosedive to a mere 16.5% chance of winning the election after a historically bad debate performance. He is followed up by Kamala Harris (10.5%), Gavin Newsom (5.7%), Michelle Obama (3.6%), and a slew of other potential fly-by-night Democratic nominees. The Democrat party is in utter disarray, and with just four months to unify behind a candidate, they are losing ground every day. Meanwhile, Trump is gaining steam, and talk of an inevitable Trump presidency is setting in. The only potential challenger who has shown any promise in the polls, former First Lady Michelle Obama, has been rumored to be against the idea of running entirely. Unfortunately for Democrats, at this point, there is no plan for defense at all.

### Biden Has Become Embarrassing

Nobody with respect for the office of the presidency of the United States liked the look of the first presidential debate. Biden confirmed himself to many as an embarrassment, and talk has it that Democrats up and down the ticket are actively going on the defensive in their own party, making efforts to distance themselves from Biden. With that kind of fracturing surrounding the central figure of the party, Democrats could find themselves lacking the leadership to unify behind anyone whatsoever, and meanwhile, large portions of the voter base are settling in on Trump. Trump is now up 2.4% in the RCP Average, which is impressive in itself, but translates to an even bigger electoral win.

### Our Election Simulation Predicts a Strong Trump Showing

Trump was already gaining considerable ground prior to the debate with even Nate Silver giving him a 67% chance to win. Our model currently shows Trump at 81.7%. With a firm hold in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, Trump will be freed up to go on the offensive with his massive arsenal of money raised. With a strategic defense in those states, a strong campaign in Pennsylvania and the Rust Belt could all but assure his victory. As of now, a simple win in Michigan could be enough to carry him over the top, and the momentum is his for the taking.

### The Payoff

A bet on Trump at a 56.2% chance of winning would yield a 77.9% return, i.e., a $100 bet would yield $177.90. Given our model’s 81.7% chance for Trump to win, this $100 bet on Trump represents an expected value of $145.37. This could be a good value as a hedge against the uncertainty that a Trump Presidency would bring. For example, worries about a slowdown in economic growth due to slowed immigration or even deportation could be somewhat offset. Gambling is not recommended, but to the savvy speculator, a negative correlation with other bets could make this attractive.
